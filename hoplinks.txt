Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
Welcome aboard. You just made a smart move.
Your 7-Day Keto Kickstart Plan is attached / linked below. Here's what to do right now:

Hit the grocery store this weekend

One thing that trips up most guys over 40 with keto: they try to do too much at once. This plan is designed to ease you in. No dramatic overnight changes. Just follow Day 1, then Day 2, and let momentum build.
If you want to take it even further, I found a 14-day keto program that's getting insane results — it's built around simple soup recipes that keep you full and in ketosis without any complicated meal prep:

Subject: The #1 mistake men over 40 make on keto
Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
Quick question: have you started Day 1 yet?
If so, nice work. If not, no judgment — today is a great day to start.
Either way, I want to warn you about the biggest mistake I see men over 40 make when starting keto:
They slash calories AND carbs at the same time.
Your body can only handle one big change at a time. When you cut both, your energy crashes, you get irritable, and you quit by Thursday.
The fix? During your first week, eat until you're satisfied. Don't worry about portions. Just focus on keeping carbs under 30g. The calorie reduction happens naturally once your body adapts to burning fat.
That's exactly how the 7-Day Kickstart is structured. Follow it and you won't have this problem.
And if you want a done-for-you program that handles all the meal planning and portions automatically, this 21-day smoothie program is the simplest approach I've seen — just blend and drink:

EMAIL 3 — Day 3
Subject: How to survive the "keto flu" (do this today)
Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
Days 2-4 are where most guys quit keto. Here's why:
Your body is switching fuel sources — from glucose to fat. During this transition, you might feel foggy, tired, or get headaches. People call it the "keto flu."
But here's what most people don't know: it's almost entirely an electrolyte issue.
Here's the protocol from the Kickstart Plan:

Sodium: Add extra salt to everything. Seriously.
Potassium: Eat an avocado a day or supplement with potassium citrate
Magnesium: 400mg magnesium glycinate before bed

Do this and the "keto flu" is either mild or nonexistent.
I also keep bone broth on hand during the first week — one cup in the afternoon kills the brain fog almost instantly. Speaking of soups, this 14-day keto soup program is built entirely around this idea — warm, filling soups that keep you in ketosis and beat the flu:

Push through this part and by Day 5-6, you're going to feel a surge of energy and mental clarity that's hard to describe. That's your body running on fat. It's worth it.
Keep going,

EMAIL 4 — Day 5
Subject: Why keto works differently after 40 (the testosterone connection)
Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
Here's something most keto guides won't tell you:
After 40, your testosterone levels start declining about 1-2% per year. Lower T means more belly fat, less muscle, less energy, and a slower metabolism. It's a vicious cycle.
Here's where keto comes in: healthy fats are the building blocks of testosterone production. When you switch to a high-fat diet, you're giving your body the raw materials it needs to support healthy T-levels.
This is why a lot of guys over 40 report not just weight loss on keto, but also better energy, better sleep, and just generally feeling more like themselves again.
It's not magic — it's biology working in your favor for once.
The key is eating the RIGHT fats:

Grass-fed beef and butter
Wild-caught salmon
Avocados and olive oil
Eggs (yes, the whole egg)

Avoid: seed oils (canola, soybean, vegetable oil). These are inflammatory and work against you.
If you want to accelerate your fat loss alongside keto, this natural metabolism booster is the #1 weight loss supplement right now — it pairs perfectly with what you're already doing:

EMAIL 5 — Day 7
Subject: You just finished Week 1. Here's what's next.
Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
If you followed the 7-Day Kickstart Plan, congratulations — you've done something that 90% of people who "try keto" never accomplish: you made it through the hardest week.
By now you should be noticing:

Clothes fitting a little better
Less bloating
More steady energy throughout the day
Fewer cravings for sugar and carbs

The question is: what now?
You have two options:
Option A: Keep doing what you're doing. Repeat Week 1 or wing it on your own. This works for some people, but most guys lose momentum without a structured plan.
Option B: Graduate to a full program that builds on your Week 1 foundation. Here are my two top recommendations depending on your style:
If you liked the meal structure and want 14 more days of done-for-you keto meals:

If you want a simpler approach — just blend a smoothie and go:

Either way, I'm proud of you for making it this far.

EMAIL 6 — Day 9
Subject: The "lazy keto" approach that actually works
Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
I want to introduce you to a concept called "lazy keto."
It's exactly what it sounds like: you focus on one thing only — keeping net carbs under 20-30g per day. That's it. No tracking calories. No weighing food. No apps.
For men over 40 with busy lives, this is often the most sustainable approach. Here's why:
Strict keto is great for the first month when you're building habits. But long-term, the guys who succeed are the ones who make it EASY on themselves.
Lazy keto rules:

Protein at every meal (steak, chicken, fish, eggs)
Add fat for flavor (butter, olive oil, cheese)
Fill the rest with green vegetables
Skip anything white (bread, rice, pasta, sugar)

That's the whole system. If you follow those 4 rules, you'll stay in ketosis without the hassle.
And if you want to supercharge your results without adding any complexity, this natural supplement is designed to boost your metabolism and support fat burning — just take it daily alongside your keto meals:

EMAIL 7 — Day 12
Subject: What to do when the scale stops moving
Hey {{ subscriber.first_name }},
At some point — usually around week 2-3 — the scale stalls. Every single person who does keto hits this.
Don't panic. Here's what's happening:
Your body lost a bunch of water weight in Week 1 (that's normal). Now it's transitioning to actual fat burning, which is slower but permanent.
Here are 3 things that restart progress:
1. Try intermittent fasting. Skip breakfast 2-3 days a week. Just have black coffee and eat your first meal at noon. This pairs incredibly well with keto for men over 40.
2. Move more, but smarter. You don't need a gym. Walk 30 minutes a day and do a few sets of push-ups and squats. That's enough to boost your metabolism.
3. Check your hidden carbs. Sauces, dressings, and "sugar-free" snacks can have more carbs than you think.
If you want a proven system that combines intermittent fasting with the right eating strategy — this is the program I recommend most for breaking through plateaus:
